# streamdeck-thirst-control-plugin
Plugin for the elgato stream Deck to control the Discord bot "Thirst"

based on
- streamdeck JS template by elgato (https://github.com/elgatosf/streamdeck-plugintemplate)
- Discord Message plugin by logically sound (https://github.com/logicallysound/streamdeck-discord-message)

At the moment it is a very raw draft that can send messages to discord, and so control thist very clumsy.
